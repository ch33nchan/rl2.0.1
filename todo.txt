- Alternative Advantage Estimation Methods Beyond GAE and REINFORCE
RL2 currently implements two advantage estimation methods: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) and REINFORCE algs.py:54-105 . The best alternative methods to implement would be:

V-trace - Particularly beneficial for off-policy learning and distributed training, offering better sample efficiency than GAE in multi-worker environments
Retrace(λ) - Provides safe off-policy corrections with lower variance than importance sampling methods
TD(λ) advantage estimation - Offers a middle ground between temporal difference and Monte Carlo methods with adjustable bias-variance trade-off
Clipped importance sampling advantages - Useful for off-policy data and can improve sample efficiency in experience replay scenarios
Multi-step returns with different bootstrapping strategies - Can provide better long-term credit assignment than standard GAE
Model Formats Beyond HuggingFace Transformers
RL2 currently uses HuggingFace's AutoLigerKernelForCausalLM for actor models and AutoModelForTokenClassification for critic models actor.py:202 critic.py:1-50 . Beneficial additional model format support would include:

JAX/Flax models - Superior performance on TPUs and better memory efficiency for large-scale training
Native PyTorch modules - Support for custom architectures and research models not available in HuggingFace
ONNX format - Optimized inference and cross-framework compatibility
Quantized model formats - Int8/Int4 quantization for memory-efficient deployment
xFormers/Flash Attention implementations - Memory-efficient attention mechanisms for longer sequences
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures - Specialized model formats for scaling while maintaining efficiency
State Space Models (SSMs) - Linear attention alternatives like Mamba for long sequence modeling
